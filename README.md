# Enterovirus antigen landscape in children with islet autoimmunity

This repository contains the code that was used in the analyses for
“Distinct enterovirus antigen landscape in children with islet
autoimmunity”, published in the \*\*\*\*\* journal as
[update_with_link](). This paper examines antigens identified by VirScan
in two paediatric cohorts, Viruses In the Genetically at Risk (VIGR) and
Environmental Determinants of Islet Autoimmunity (ENDIA).

(R)mds are named to reflect their associated figure in the paper.
