This repository contains the code that was used in the analyses for
“Distinct enterovirus antigen landscape in children with islet
autoimmunity”, published in the \*\*\*\*\* journal as [link]().

Each Rmd is associated with a specific figure in the paper. To reproduce
the figures, please run the code in order of the Rmds.
